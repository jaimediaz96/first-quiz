# Security Audit for Solar Panel Installation App

## Using the OWASP Top 10 - 2021 as a guide

### A01:2021 - Broken Access Control
- Ensure that access control mechanisms are properly implemented to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data and resources.
- Review and limit access permissions for all users, especially software engineer employees, customer support employees, and the sales employee.
- Implement robust session management to prevent unauthorized access.

### A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures
- Verify that sensitive data, including customer passwords and financial information, is properly encrypted using strong encryption algorithms.
- Review the handling of cryptographic keys and ensure they are stored securely.
- Implement secure key management practices to prevent data exposure.

### A03:2021 - Injection
- Review code for any potential injection vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Validate and sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks.
- Use parameterized queries, prepared statements in database interactions and input validation libraries to eliminate injection vulnerabilities..

### A04:2021 - Insecure Design
- Implement threat modeling and secure design patterns.
- Conduct regular design reviews to identify and address flaws in the application's architecture.
- Ensure the use of secure reference architectures for components.

### A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration
- Review and secure the configuration of the Kubernetes containers and AWS services.
- Limit public access to sensitive data and APIs.
- Regularly audit and patch misconfigurations.

### A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- Continuously monitor for known vulnerabilities in all components and dependencies.
- Establish a process for tracking and updating components with security patches.
- Remove or replace components with high-risk vulnerabilities.

### A07:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures
- Ensure strong authentication methods are used for user identification.
- Implement multi-factor authentication for sensitive actions.
- Review and eliminate any identification-related vulnerabilities.
- Enforce or implement role-based access control (RBAC).

### A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures
- Verify the integrity of software updates, critical data and data in CI/CD pipelines.
- Implement secure deserialization practices to prevent integrity failures.
- Monitor for and mitigate integrity-related risks.
- Use digital signatures, checksums, and other integrity checks to ensure data authenticity and prevent tampering.

### A09:2021 - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
- Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities to capture security-relevant events.
- Implement alerting mechanisms for unusual activities or potential security incidents.
-  Collect and analyze logs to detect anomalies, identify potential security breaches, and facilitate incident response.
- Regularly review logs and perform forensic analysis.

### A10:2021 - Server-Side Request Forgery
- Review application code for potential SSRF vulnerabilities.
- Validate and sanitize user-controlled URLs.
- Implement proper input validation to prevent SSRF attacks.

## General Security
- Enforce strong password policies for all users, especially customers.
- Regularly perform security assessments, including penetration testing and code reviews.
- Educate and train employees on security best practices.
- Implement access controls and least privilege principles for employees.
- Monitor for and respond to security incidents promptly.
- Perform regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities in the system.
- Develop and maintain an incident response plan to effectively handle security incidents and minimize their impact.
